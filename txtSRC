Always remember
you matter
braver than you believe
stronger than you seem
smarter than you think
and loved more than you know

A smile can hide a tear
A laugh can hide a tear
But you must stay strong
and carry on
because you matter

somedays you don't want
to get out of bed and pull
the covers over your head
I throw those covers back
get up and say
I matter

Let this be your daily reminder
Today, tomorrow, always
I matter

I matter, you matter, we matter
Today, tomorrow, always

Remind you that no matter who you are or where you're from, we care.

I am I can I breathe I see

I matter because my unique craziness brings joy to people
